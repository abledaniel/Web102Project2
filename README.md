This Project is the Second Codepath Project in Web102 Yippie!!

In it the project contains useState for variables and components, passes JSON so cards info can be changed which is contained in questions.jsx.

Uses onClick for both the flipping of the card and switching the questions. 


The Quiz and JSON code looks like this:
